## Project Overview:
Welcome to my project! This repository contains a web project where I've practiced HTML and CSS while learning. 
The project focuses on implementing best practices and principles of HTML and CSS.

## Project Structure:
1. index.html: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point of the web project.

4.CSS Resets: Using CSS resets to normalize styles across different browsers.
5.Comments: Adding meaningful comments in HTML and CSS files to explain code structure and functionality.
6. File Organization: Organizing files and directories logically for better project management.
